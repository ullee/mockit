<h2>MockIt: A tool to quickly create mocked APIs.</h2>
<p>Stop wasting time mocking APIs. MockIt gives you an interface to configure and create REAL mocked endpoints for your applications. Whilst you wait for APIS to be built use MockIt to talk to a real service.</>

# The problem

When building applications you often need to interact with services. When the services are not ready to be consumed you have a few options:

1. Mock out the response with a JSON file
2. Create a mock service yourself
3. Use MockIt.

# This solution

This tool was designed to help developers quickly create endpoints for their applications. No need to create a server, just use docker and run this project locally. You can create, edit and manage routes to your API. Every change to the API will be reflected on the server and updated straight away.

This tool comes with a few features out the box:

- CORS
- Basic Authentication
- Chaos Monkey (Unleash a monkey to take down your endpoints)

More information about how it works, its features can be found on the docs.

[Read the docs and get started](https://mockit.netlify.com/)

# Getting Started with HiveMQ cloud

_Make sure you have docker running_

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ullee/mockit.git
```

```sh
cd mockit && docker-compose up --build -d
```

```sh
cd mockit/mocket-routes && npm install
```

Once everything is up and running go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to see MockIt.

For instructions on how to use MockIt please see the [documentation](https://mockit.netlify.com/docs/getting-started/routes).

## Mqtt Local install and running tests

1. Make your HiveMQ account 
- ref. https://console.hivemq.cloud/

2. Fix code 
- cf. [code](https://github.com/ullee/mockit/blob/1e133308b2aa845aa015c108b38f7a2ffcfd391f/mockit-routes/src/index.js#L3)

3. Build project
```sh
docker-compose up --build -d
```

4. Install mqtt-cli client
```sh
brew tap hivemq/mqtt-cli
brew install mqtt-cli
```

5. Subscribe topic
```sh
mqtt sub -h 572e8b3345974705bcbec7d11e7513be.s1.eu.hivemq.cloud -p 8883 -s -u ullee -pw -t 'my/test/topic'
```

# Viewing the dashboard, server and API

Once Docker is running you have three applications running on the machine.

1. The client: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
2. The client-server: [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
3. The MockIt API (this is the server that runs your API): [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

If you want to view the dashboard to get started go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

If you want to interact with your new API go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

For example, if you have a `/user` route setup, go to [http://localhost:3000/user](http://localhost:3000/user) to view the data.
